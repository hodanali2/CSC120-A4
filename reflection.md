- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
Encapsulation aafects my programming in away that I thought was intresting and I havenot seen it in python as well. Meaning for example, we could hide information by using private which means it only existed within that method and not accessible to the outside of that method.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The things that worked for me is follwing the directions line by line and doing one step at time instead of doing everything once. What did not work for me is treating java like python which is what I got used it, however I realized and learned through it that there are different functions in java that mean different things and I feel like I am realizing more what the object oriented programming does and there is no sequence or like steps being followed. My advice to anyone taking this course is take advantage of the resources like if you are stuck ask help your classmates, go to TA and go to office hourse. 



PS: in this assignment besides office hours and TA I got help from the java website, and some of my classmates.
